# Data preprocessing workflow

Once obtained all files from the `obtain_data` workflow, this workflow will get all data ready for analysis.

## Important remarks


## Recomendations
Run the workflow in a machine with at least 20GB of RAM using
```
snakemake --cores 6
```
In case you want to run the rules on your cluster, refer to [snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cluster.html).
